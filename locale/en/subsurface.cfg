[item-description]
fluid-elevator=Connect them like underground pipes.\nUse __CONTROL__rotate__ to switch flow direction after placement.
item-elevator=Connect them like underground belts.\nUse __CONTROL__rotate__ to switch transport direction after placement.
cave-sealing=Throw some stones to seal caves or tunnel entrances that you don't need anymore!
placement-restriction=[font=default-bold][color=yellow]Can't be placed in subsurfaces.[/color][/font]

[entity-description]
tunnel-entrance-cable=Step down into the darkness of your planet! Press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__, but beware pollution and the missing daylight.
tunnel-exit-cable=Climb up into daylight! Press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__ to breathe fresh air and see daylight again.
surface-drill=Make sure the excavated material is disposed of and wait and see what happens.\n[font=default-bold][color=yellow]Beware that once the entrance is digged, it can't be removed anymore.[/color][/font]
fluid-elevator=Use __CONTROL__rotate__ (rotate) to switch flow direction.\nYou can still use __CONTROL__reverse-rotate__ (reverse rotate) to rotate anti-clockwise.
item-elevator=Use __CONTROL__rotate__ (rotate) to switch transport direction.\nYou can still use __CONTROL__reverse-rotate__ (reverse rotate) to rotate anti-clockwise.
active-air-vent=The active air vent moves pollution bottom-up, but needs electicity to run.\n[font=default-bold]Max. throughput:[/font] __1__/min
air-vent=The passive air vent equalizes pollution between both surfaces. If the oversurface is more polluted it will diffuse to the underground, so make sure there is enough space for it to dissipate. It doesn't need electricity to run.
prospector=Scans for nearby resources.
support=A support to prevent collapses, includes electricity and light.
subway=An inter-surface train connection.

cannot-place-here=Subsurface is not exposed or occupied at this position
not-allowed-here=Surface drilling is not allowed here
suffocation=You are suffocating because there is too much pollution in here!

miner-inventory-full=Miner's inventory is full. It won't move until it is cleared.
subsurface-name=__1__ subsurface level __2__
unit_digging=Activate this to dig straight through the underground instead of finding paths around obstacles to the next waypoint.

[mod-setting-name]
pollution-trains=Trains cause pollution
pollution-trains-excludes=Prevent electric trains from polluting
subsurface-limit=Subsurface limit
generate-resources-underground=Generate resources underground
enable-challenges=Enable underground challenges
enable-quality=Enable quality in subsurfaces

[mod-setting-description]
pollution-trains=Enable this for harder challenge of handling underground trains
pollution-trains-excludes=Enter all prototype names of locomotives you don't want to cause pollution (electric locomotives). Comma-separated list.
subsurface-limit=Number of maximum available subsurfaces.\nChanging this setting while deeper subsurfaces exist does NOT delete them.
generate-resources-underground=If enabled, resources will be generated in subsurfaces as well with a decreased resource yield on the surface. Starting patches are left untouched and won't be generated in subsurfaces.\nIf you play custom world types, like railworld, you may disable this setting.\n[color=yellow]Changing this setting does not affect existing resources![/color]
enable-challenges=If enabled, subsurfaces become more challenging with pollution effects and enemies spawning, but offer more features in return.\nIf you want to use this mod just to declutter your base without any additional challenges and features, you may disable this setting.
enable-quality=Enable quality as global effect in subsurfaces
