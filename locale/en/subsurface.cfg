[item-description]
fluid-elevator=Connect them like underground pipes.\nUse __CONTROL__rotate__ to switch flow direction after placement.
item-elevator=Connect them like underground belts.\nUse __CONTROL__rotate__ to switch transport direction after placement.
cave-sealing=Throw some stones to seal caves or tunnel entrances that you don't need anymore!
placement-restriction=[font=default-bold][color=yellow]Can't be placed in subsurfaces.[/color][/font]

[entity-description]
tunnel-entrance-cable=Step down into the darkness of your planet! Press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__, but beware pollution and the missing daylight.
tunnel-exit-cable=Climb up into daylight! Press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__ to breathe fresh air and see daylight again.
surface-drill=Make sure the excavated material is disposed of and wait and see what happens.\n[font=default-bold][color=yellow]Beware that once the entrance is digged, it can't be removed anymore.[/color][/font]
fluid-elevator=Use __CONTROL__rotate__ (rotate) to switch flow direction.\nYou can still use __CONTROL__reverse-rotate__ (reverse rotate) to rotate anti-clockwise.
item-elevator=Use __CONTROL__rotate__ (rotate) to switch transport direction.\nYou can still use __CONTROL__reverse-rotate__ (reverse rotate) to rotate anti-clockwise.
active-air-vent=The active air vent moves pollution bottom-up, but needs electicity to run.\n\nThroughput is determined by base crafting speed plus double module speed bonus with a reduction of 80% per subsurface level.
air-vent=The passive air vent equalizes pollution between both surfaces. If the oversurface is more polluted it will diffuse to the underground, so make sure there is enough space for it to dissipate. It doesn't need electricity to run.
prospector=Finds the richest resource spot within a radius of 64 tiles.
support=A support to prevent collapses, includes electricity and light.
subway=An inter-surface train connection.

[mod-setting-description]
pollution-trains=Enable this for harder challenge of handling underground trains
pollution-trains-excludes=Enter all prototype names of locomotives you don't want to cause pollution (electric locomotives). Comma-separated list.
subsurface-limit=Number of maximum available subsurfaces.\nChanging this setting while deeper subsurfaces exist does NOT delete them.
generate-resources-underground=If enabled, resources will be generated in subsurfaces as well with a decreased resource yield on the surface. Starting patches are left untouched and won't be generated in subsurfaces.\nIf you play custom world types, like railworld, you may disable this setting.\n[color=yellow]Changing this setting does not affect existing resources![/color]
enable-challenges=If enabled, subsurfaces become more challenging with pollution effects and enemies spawning, but offer more features in return.\nIf you want to use this mod just to declutter your base without any additional challenges and features, you may disable this setting.

subways=Subways

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
subsurface=Step down into the darkness of your planet! Press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__ to change layers.\n[entity=tunnel-entrance-cable] and exit can be connected to the electric and circuit network to transmit power and signals between layers.\nUse [entity=wooden-support] or [entity=steel-support] to distribute power. Supports also provide a light source.
clear-subsurface-deconstruction=Mark areas in subsurfaces to be cleared by construction robots using the deconstruction planner (__CONTROL__select-for-cancel-deconstruct__). The robots will mine all walls touching the area automatically. If the area is completely in the void, nothing happens.\nNote that the "cancel deconstruction order" action must be used here.
inter-surface-transport=Transport items, fluids or heat between layers. The markers show you the correct position to place the opposite part. Switch input and output using __CONTROL__rotate__ after placement and __CONTROL__reverse-rotate__ to rotate anti-clockwise (only for item and fluid elevators).
subways=Subways allow trains to travel between levels.\nPlace a [entity=subway] on both levels using the markers (similar to [tip=inter-surface-transport]).\nAdd a subway to the train schedule. All train stops from all levels are available in the list to allow multi-level schedules. Interrupts can be tricky though, make sure they activate when on the correct level.\nTrains entering a subway will keep their speed. They can't be controlled and will not steer until fully appeared, so make sure that your underground rail network can handle the longest train you send there without getting stuck. It is possible for one train to be in two subways at the same time.
