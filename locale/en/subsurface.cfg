[item-name]
fluid-elevator=Fluid elevator
cave-sealing=Cave sealing

[item-description]
fluid-elevator=Connect them like underground pipes.\nUse __CONTROL__rotate__ to switch flow direction after placement.
item-elevator=Connect them like underground belts.\nUse __CONTROL__rotate__ to switch transport direction after placement.
active-air-vent=The active air vent moves pollution bottom-up, but needs electicity to run.
air-vent=The passive air vent just equalizes pollution between both surfaces. If the oversurface is more polluted it will diffuse to the underground, so make sure there is enough space for it to dissipate. It doesn't need electricity to run.
cave-sealing=Throw some stones to seal caves or tunnel entrances that you don't need anymore!

[entity-description]
tunnel-entrance-cable=Step down into the darkness of your planet! Press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__, but beware pollution and the missing daylight.
tunnel-exit-cable=Climb up into daylight! Press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__ to breathe fresh air and see daylight again.
surface-drill=Make sure the excavated material is disposed of and wait and see what happens.\n[font=default-bold][color=yellow]Beware that once the entrance is digged, it can't be removed anymore.[/color][/font]
fluid-elevator-input=Use __CONTROL__rotate__ (rotate) to switch flow direction.\nYou can still use __CONTROL__reverse-rotate__ (reverse rotate) to rotate anti-clockwise.
fluid-elevator-output=Use __CONTROL__rotate__ (rotate) to switch flow direction.\nYou can still use __CONTROL__reverse-rotate__ (reverse rotate) to rotate anti-clockwise.
item-elevator-=Use __CONTROL__rotate__ (rotate) to switch transport direction.\nYou can still use __CONTROL__reverse-rotate__ (reverse rotate) to rotate anti-clockwise.
prospector=Prospects resources in the lower subsurface in a circular area with a radius of 6 chunks.
wooden-support=A support to prevent collapses, includes electricity and light.

caveground=Caveground

[subsurface]
cannot-place-here=Subsurface is not exposed or occupied at this position
suffocation=You are suffocating because there is too much pollution in here!
limit-reached=The allowed limit of subsurfaces is reached!
miner-inventory-full=Miner's inventory is full. It won't move until it is cleared.

pollution-trains-excludes=Enter all prototype names of locomotives you don't want to cause pollution (electric locomotives). Comma-separated list.
subsurface-limit=Number of maximum available subsurfaces.\nChanging this setting while deeper subsurfaces exist does NOT delete them.
